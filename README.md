# Readee

Readee addresses a fundamental challenge in online learning and reading comprehension: the difficulty of visualizing and understanding complex terms and concepts. The tool was created for a hackathon within a 24-hour constraint. It uses Echo3D's JS SDK, and GPT-4 API via Node.js hosted on an Amazon AWS EC2 instance. The front-end and button injection was made by using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
